# JDBC-learning-basic-stage-
Too many things have happened these days, so I didn't continue to write, but my JDBC part has ended, and now I start the content of the Java Web phase. I have finally completed the PS part of studying abroad. I really don't know how long it has been done. There are many things to be distributed today, which is the basic stage of JDBC. Recently, I'm really crazy about this PTE, but I don't think it will be particularly difficult if I pass it. I think my English foundation is pretty good, but reading is a little poor. It's strange. Others generally have better reading and listening. I'm better at the other two, but my listening is also OK. Reading is really difficult, Fortunately, reading only needs practice. I don't know if it will be all the original questions by the time of the formal exam. I can only keep saying to myself: life will always get better, but it's really difficult to get better. Yesterday, I saw a high school classmate enter Ali, but it's an operation post. I really despise the operation post, product post and sales post, I don't know why the salary can be so high. I think the basic salary of programmers should be very, very high. It's really disgusting for such people to spread anxiety. In fact, I still have a lot to say. When I had lunch yesterday, the food was sour. I don't want to say anything. Write here first. I hope my PTE can pass!
